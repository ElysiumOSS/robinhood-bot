## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your Robinhood Trading Bot up and running.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Python 3.8+**: Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Robinhood Account**: You will need an active Robinhood brokerage account.
*   **Twitter API Keys (Optional)**: If you plan to use the sentiment analysis strategy, you'll need a [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) to obtain API keys (`Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret`).
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Setup for Robinhood**:
    *   Log into your Robinhood account.
    *   Navigate to `Menu` > `Security and privacy` > `Two-Factor Authentication`.
    *   Choose "Authenticator App" (e.g., Duo Mobile, Google Authenticator).
    *   Copy the secret key provided by Robinhood. This key is your `ROBINHOOD_MFA_CODE`. You will use this key in your authenticator app to generate TOTP codes.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ElysiumOSS/robinhood-bot.git
    cd robinhood-bot
    ```

2.  **Run the Initialization Script**:
    The `initialize.sh` script will set up your Python virtual environment, install all necessary dependencies, and create a `.env` file for your credentials.

    ```bash
    sh initialize.sh
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>💡 What <code>initialize.sh</code> does:</summary>
    The script performs the following actions:
    1.  Checks if a virtual environment named `env` exists. If not, it creates one.
    2.  Activates the virtual environment.
    3.  Upgrades `pip` to the latest version.
    4.  Installs all Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
    5.  Installs `pre-commit` hooks for automatic code formatting and linting.
    6.  Creates a `.env` file from the `.env.example` template if it doesn't exist.
    </details>

### Configuration

After running `initialize.sh`, you **must** update the `.env` file with your actual credentials.

1.  **Open the `.env` file**:
    ```bash
    nano .env
    # or use your preferred text editor
    ```

2.  **Populate your credentials**:
    Replace the placeholder values with your actual Robinhood and (optional) Twitter API credentials.

    ```dotenv
    # .env.example
    # This file is a template for the required environment variables.
    # Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual credentials.
    # Do NOT commit the .env file to version control.

    # Twitter API Credentials (Optional - only for sentiment analysis bot)
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY"
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET"

    # Robinhood Credentials
    ROBINHOOD_USER="YOUR_ROBINHOOD_EMAIL"
    ROBINHOOD_PASS="YOUR_ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD"
    ROBINHOOD_MFA_CODE="YOUR_ROBINHOOD_MFA_SECRET_KEY"
    ```

3.  **Activate your virtual environment**:
    Always ensure your virtual environment is active when running the bot or installing packages.
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

## 💡 Usage & Workflows

Once configured, you can start using the existing strategies or create your own.

### Using Existing Strategies

To use the pre-built trading algorithms, create a new Python script in the project's root directory.

1.  **Import and Configure the `TradeBot`**:
    ```python
    # my_trade.py
    from src.bots.base_trade_bot import TradeBot
    from src.bots.config import TradingConfig, StrategyType

    # 1. Configure the strategies you want to use
    my_config = TradingConfig(
        enabled_strategies=[
            StrategyType.SMA_CROSSOVER,
            StrategyType.SENTIMENT,
        ],
        strategy_weights={
            StrategyType.SMA_CROSSOVER: 0.6,
            StrategyType.SENTIMENT: 0.4,
        }
    )

    # 2. Initialize the TradeBot with your configuration
    trade_bot = TradeBot(config=my_config)

    # 3. Execute a trade decision for a specific ticker
    trade_bot.execute_trade_decision(ticker="AAPL")
    ```

2.  **Run your script**:
    Make sure your virtual environment is active.
    ```bash
    python my_trade.py
    ```

    The `execute_trade_decision()` function will connect to Robinhood, fetch necessary data, apply the configured strategies, and execute a trade if the combined signal meets the configured thresholds.

### Creating a Custom Strategy

The framework is designed for easy extension. You can create your own custom trading logic by adding a new strategy function.

1.  **Create a new function in `trading_strategies.py`**:
    In `src/bots/trading_strategies.py`, create a new Python function that takes a ticker and a configuration object as input and returns a float between -1.0 (strong sell) and 1.0 (strong buy).

    ```python
    # src/bots/trading_strategies.py

    def calculate_my_custom_signal(df: pd.DataFrame, config: MyCustomConfig) -> float:
        """
        Implement your custom trading algorithm here.
        """
        # Your logic here
        return 0.0
    ```

2.  **Add your strategy to `StrategyType`**:
    In `src/bots/config.py`, add your new strategy to the `StrategyType` enum.

    ```python
    # src/bots/config.py

    class StrategyType(Enum):
        # ... existing strategies
        MY_CUSTOM_STRATEGY = "my_custom_strategy"
    ```

3.  **Integrate your strategy into `TradeBot`**:
    In `src/bots/base_trade_bot.py`, update the `calculate_strategy_signals` method to include your new strategy.

    ```python
    # src/bots/base_trade_bot.py

    # ... inside calculate_strategy_signals
            elif strategy == StrategyType.MY_CUSTOM_STRATEGY:
                signals[strategy] = calculate_my_custom_signal(
                    df, self.config.my_custom_config
                )
    ```

### Sample Algorithm Explanations

Here's a brief overview of the algorithms implemented in the existing strategies:

<details>
<summary><h4>📈 Moving Average Comparison (<code>calculate_sma_signal</code>)</h4></summary>
This algorithm calculates two Simple Moving Averages (SMAs): a 50-day SMA and a 200-day SMA. These are derived from historical stock prices.
*   **Buy Recommendation**: Made when the 50-day moving average is strictly greater than the 200-day moving average (a "golden cross" signal, often considered bullish).
*   **Sell Recommendation**: Made when the 50-day moving average is strictly less than the 200-day moving average (a "death cross" signal, often considered bearish).
*   **No Recommendation**: If the two moving averages are equal.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>📊 Volume-Weighted Average Price Comparison (<code>calculate_vwap_signal</code>)</h4></summary>
The Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark that represents the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. It's calculated by summing the dollar value of all shares traded and dividing by the total shares traded over a specific period.
*   **Buy Recommendation**: Made when the current price of a security is below its VWAP (suggesting the stock is undervalued or trading at a discount for the day).
*   **Sell Recommendation**: Made when the current price of a security is above its VWAP (suggesting the stock is overvalued or trading at a premium for the day).
*   **No Recommendation**: If neither of the above conditions are met.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>🐦 Sentiment Analysis (<code>calculate_sentiment_signal</code>)</h4></summary>
This algorithm harnesses the power of social media by sourcing tweets mentioning a specific company via the Twitter API.
*   A sentiment analysis is performed on each collected tweet, assigning a score (negative, neutral, or positive).
*   The average sentiment score for all relevant tweets is calculated.
*   **Buy Recommendation**: Made if the average sentiment is positive.
*   **Sell Recommendation**: Made if the average sentiment is negative.
*   **No Recommendation**: If the average sentiment is neutral.
</details>

## ⚠️ Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap

Understanding the current state and future direction of the project is crucial.

### Current Limitations
*   **No True Backtesting**: The current framework does not include a dedicated backtesting module to evaluate strategy performance on historical data.
*   **Basic Risk Management**: Lacks advanced risk management features like stop-loss, take-profit orders, or portfolio-level risk assessment.
*   **Robinhood API Constraints**: Dependent on `robin_stocks` library and Robinhood's public API limitations, which may include rate limits, available order types, and data refresh rates.
*   **Single Ticker Focus**: The bot is designed to trade one ticker at a time per execution; no multi-asset portfolio management.
*   **No Persistent State**: Bot state (e.g., open positions, historical trades for analysis) is not persistently stored by the bot itself across runs.

### Known Issues
*   **MFA Code Generation**: Users sometimes struggle with correctly obtaining and using the `ROBINHOOD_MFA_CODE` (secret key) rather than a time-based OTP. Ensure you copy the *secret key* given by Robinhood for authenticator app setup.
*   **Rate Limiting**: Frequent calls to Robinhood or Twitter APIs might lead to temporary rate limiting. Implement delays between calls if experiencing issues.

### Future Roadmap
The following enhancements are planned or under consideration:

*   **📈 Dedicated Backtesting Module**: Allow users to test their algorithms against historical market data before live deployment.
*   **🛡️ Advanced Risk Management**: Integrate features like configurable stop-loss/take-profit, position sizing, and diversified portfolio management.
*   **🐳 Dockerization**: Provide Docker images and Docker Compose configurations for easier deployment and environment consistency.
*   **🌐 Web User Interface (UI)**: Develop a simple web interface for monitoring bot activity, configuring strategies, and viewing performance.
*   **📊 Performance Tracking & Reporting**: Implement logging and reporting tools to track bot performance over time.
*   **🔄 Recurring Trades**: Add functionality to schedule trades at specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly) using a scheduler like `APScheduler` or `Celery`.
*   **📨 Notification System**: Integrate with messaging services (e.g., email, Discord, Telegram) for trade alerts and status updates.

## 📚 Appendix

### FAQ

<details>
<summary><h4>❓ Is this financial advice?</h4></summary>
⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**: No, absolutely not. Any stock or ticker mentioned, and any strategy implemented by this bot, is not to be taken as financial advice. You are using this bot at your own discretion and with the full knowledge that you can lose part or all of your investment. Automated trading carries significant risks, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Always conduct your own research and consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>❓ How do I get Twitter API keys?</h4></summary>
You need to apply for a Twitter Developer Account.
1.  Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).
2.  Sign up for a developer account and create a new project/app.
3.  Generate your API Key (`Consumer Key`) and API Secret (`Consumer Secret`). These will be used for `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` and `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET` in your `.env` file.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>❓ Can I run this bot continuously?</h4></summary>
Yes, you can. For continuous operation, you might consider setting up a cron job on a Linux system or a scheduled task on Windows to run your trading script at desired intervals. However, remember the limitations (e.g., rate limits) and ensure proper error handling and logging for long-running processes. For production, consider using containerization (Docker) and dedicated server environments.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>❓ What happens if my Robinhood MFA code expires or changes?</h4></summary>
The `ROBINHOOD_MFA_CODE` is the *secret key* you get when initially setting up an authenticator app, not the time-based OTP. This secret key generally does not expire unless you explicitly disable and re-enable MFA for your Robinhood account. If you do, you'll need to update the `ROBINHOOD_MFA_CODE` in your `.env` file with the new secret key.
</details>

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><h4>🐛 `robin_stocks.exceptions.LoginFailureException: MFA code is invalid`</h4></summary>
This error usually means the `ROBINHOOD_MFA_CODE` in your `.env` file is incorrect or not the correct type of code.
*   **Ensure it's the Secret Key**: The `ROBINHOOD_MFA_CODE` should be the **long alphanumeric secret key** that Robinhood provides when you *first set up* an authenticator app (e.g., "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP"). It is *not* the 6-digit number generated by your authenticator app.
*   **Check for Typos**: Double-check for any typos or missing characters in the key.
*   **Re-setup MFA (if necessary)**: If unsure, you might need to disable and re-enable Authenticator App MFA in Robinhood to get a fresh secret key.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>🐛 `tweepy.TweepyException: Could not authenticate to Twitter.`</h4></summary>
This indicates an issue with your `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` or `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`.
*   **Check `.env`**: Verify that `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` and `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET` in your `.env` file are correct and complete.
*   **Twitter Developer Portal**: Log in to your Twitter Developer Portal and ensure your app's API keys are still valid and that your project has the necessary permissions (e.g., "Elevated" access) to perform searches.
*   **Environment Activation**: Ensure your virtual environment is active before running the script.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>🐛 `ModuleNotFoundError` for a Python package</h4></summary>
This typically means a required package wasn't installed correctly or your virtual environment isn't active.
*   **Activate Virtual Environment**: Always run `source env/bin/activate` before trying to run the bot.
*   **Re-install Dependencies**: If the issue persists, try reinstalling all dependencies:
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
</details>
